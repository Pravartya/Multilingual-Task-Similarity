# Mutlilingual-Task-Similarity

First run the "mbert_model_training.ipynb" for getting the initial mbert model and saving it.
Then run the "All_6_model_training_evaluation.ipynb" for saving weights of 6 models considering 6 features basically training the models and finding individual pearson correlation coefficients.
Then run the "Neural_network_training.ipynb" for running the neural network model.
At last run "Final_Model_evaluation.ipynb" for combining the above two and getting final pearson correlation coefficients.


Following below are the model links which are trained in this task :
